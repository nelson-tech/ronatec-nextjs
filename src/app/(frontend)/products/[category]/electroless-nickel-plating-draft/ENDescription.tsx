        <h4>Zincate 50</h4>
        <p>
          ZINCATE 50 is a cyanide-free dilute zincate process for processing
          aluminum and its alloys. It removes aluminum oxide and applies a thin
          zinc film on the aluminum alloy by immersion to prevent its
          re-oxidation. This film can then be electroplated with copper, nickel
          and certain other electrolytic processes as well as with electroless
          nickel. The dilute ZINCATE 50 solution has low viscosity that rapidly
          penetrates the water film present on the cleaned aluminum. This new
          alloy process produces a denser, more uniform zinc film that improves
          adhesion to the aluminum, helping to insure excellent adhesion of the
          subsequent plate. This unique zincate film cannot be found with most
          other conventional zincates.
